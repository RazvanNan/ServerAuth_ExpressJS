# Server Authentication Basics in Express JS
### with sessions and passport packages

This code is from here: https://medium.com/@evangow/server-authentication-basics-express-sessions-passport-and-curl-359b7456003d

Note, in the session configuration below, I am leaving the ‘secret’ as ‘keyboard cat’, but in production you would want to replace this with a randomly generated string that’s pulled from an environment variable.

### To run a demo (both servers and client), run 
    ./runApp_AuthTut.sh

Make sure the demo file is made executable with 
```bash
chmod a+x runApp_AuthTut.sh
```
